<p> My name is Nadine Wael and I live in Cairo, Egypt. I'm a student in the American University in Cairo majoring 
    in Computer Science and minoring in Writing & Mathematics. This is a personal website about the many things 
    in life that I'm passionate about and make me happy.
</p>
<strong> Here's a list of the things i'm most passionate about: </strong>
<ol>
    <li> Photography </li>
    <li> Tv Shows </li>
    <li> Music </li>
</ol>

<h4> Photography </h4>
<p> I am obsessed with taking pictures 24/7 wherever I go. I love to travel so the inner artist in me takes over 
    and I start taking pictures of everything and everyone constantly. 
</p>

<h4> Tv Shows </h4>
<p> I've been avidly watching tv series since I was a 5 year old kid. I cannot function throughout my day
    unless I watch an episode of whatever series I decide to watch. 
</p>
<strong> This is a list of my favorite Tv Shows: </strong>
<ul>
    <li> Game Of Thrones (excluding season 8) </li>
    <li> The Handmaid's Tale </li>
    <li> BoJack Horseman </li>
    <li> Rings of Power </li>
    <li> The Office </li>
    <li> Breaking Bad </li>
    <li> American Crime Story </li>
    <li> Archer </li>
    <li> Vikings </li>
</ul>

<h4> Music </h4>
<p> Whether I'm studying, cooking, sitting doing nothing, and literally just breathing, music is always playing in 
    the background. My playlist is constantly on shuffle. I wake up to music, I can't drive unless there's 
    music playing on the radio, and I'm currently listening to Frank Ocean's "Lost" while I'm writing this.
    I literally cannot function without music in my life. 
</p>
<p> One of my ultimate favorite moments ever was being able to go to the Barcelona Primavera Music Festival 
    while I was attending my summer abroad semester. 
</p>
<p> I had the chance to watch some of my favorite artists ever perform live such as: </p>
<ol>
    <li> Jorja Smith </li>
    <li> Tyler The Creator </li>
    <li> Giveon </li>
    <li> Burna Boy </li>
    <li> Dua Lipa </li>
    <li> Tame Impala </li>
    <li> Peggy Gou </li>
